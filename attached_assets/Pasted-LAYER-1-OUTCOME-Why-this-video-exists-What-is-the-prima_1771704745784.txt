Ask like this:
Which creator best matches the vibe you want?
 (Multiple selection allowed)


Iman Gadzhi (bold captions, punchy cuts, dark tone)


Ali Abdaal (clean, educational, calm)

Ryan Trahan (storytelling + humor)


IShowSpeed (chaotic, expressive, loud)


Custom (paste link)


Paste a reference Reel or YouTube link.


Then AI should internally analyze:
Avg shot length

Now Important:
Don’t show 22 questions at once.
Structure it like:
Step 1: Goal
 Step 2: Style
 Step 3: Hook
 Step 4: Edit vibe
 Step 5: Audio
 Step 6: Structure
With quick selectable chips.

Even Smarter Approach
Instead of asking everything manually:
Let AI first analyze:
Uploaded raw video


Reference link


Then ask:
 “I’ve detected this is a talking-head productivity video. Do you want it edited in Ali Abdaal style or something more aggressive like Iman Gadzhi?”
Now AI feels intelligent.

Critical Insight
Style is not just “Iman Gadzhi style”.
AI must convert style into:
Average shot duration


Caption density


Zoom frequency


Music BPM range


Color grading tone


Hook intensity level


That’s how your blueprint becomes powerful.
